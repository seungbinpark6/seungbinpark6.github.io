Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [City and Regional Planning](https://knowlton.osu.edu/city-and-regional-planning) at The Ohio State University. My research interests lie in community and local economic development. I specialize in university-community partnerships and study how universities generate mutual benefits for their urban neighborhoods as they implement a neighborhood revitalization project. My current focus is on urban-located land-grant universities in the U.S.

In my [dissertation](/dissertation.md), I argue that it is critical to reflect the voices of community stakeholders in assessing the impacts of university-led urban neighborhood revitalization projects. It is because I have found in my cases that community leaders and residents perceive the impacts in different ways from university leaders and involved faculty. I investigate where the gaps are rooted.

I will be on the job market for the 2024--2025 academic year. Please reach out to me by clicking the email button on the left pane if you are interested.
